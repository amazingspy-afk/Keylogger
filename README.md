# Keylogger
 
A keylogger is a type of malware (malicious software) that records every keystroke made on a
computer or mobile device. This information is often sent to a remote attacker, who can use it to
steal sensitive information such as passwords and credit card numbers. Keyloggers can also be
used to monitor an individual's online activities, such as which websites they visit and what they
search for. Some keyloggers are also able to take screenshots of the device's screen, allowing the
attacker to see exactly what the user is doing. However, keyloggers can also enable
cybercriminals to eavesdrop on you, watch you on your system camera, or listen over your
smartphone's microphone. Keyloggers operate in the context of malware for our purposes, but it
is not necessarily illegal to install and use them. Keyloggers are used by IT departments to
troubleshoot technical system and network problems. It's a common tool used by
companies to track and covertly monitor their employees. The same goes for parents who want to
monitor their child's activity, for example. Suspicious spouses are another market for keyloggers. In
all such cases, if the organization or person downloading and installing the keylogger actually owns
the device, then itâ€™s perfectly legal. And there are thousands of commercially available keyloggers
on the Internet, which advertise themselves for just such a use.
However, the concern with keyloggers is that there are malicious actors behind them. And make
sure, you don't own an infected device. They don't know they have compromised your computer.

Saving yourself from the threat

Avoid keyloggers by avoiding user mistakes that lead to phone and computer
infections. Start by keeping your operating system, applications, and
web browser up to date with the latest security patches. Always be aware
of attachments you receive, especially unexpected attachments, even if
they are from people you know. If you are unsure, contact the sender to check.
Make your password long and complex and avoid using the same password for
different services. Also, the use of on-screen keyboard eliminates the chances of
falling prey to this kind of malware.Some types of keyloggers can steal
passwords you type, take periodic screenshots, record webpages
viewed, emails sent, instant messaging sessions, and even capture sensitive
financial information (such as credit card numbers). You can record , PIN code,
bank account, etc.) and send all this data over the network to a
remote her computer or her web server. A logging program operator could call up
everything there and pass it on to a third party for criminal purposes.
